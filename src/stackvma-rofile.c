/* Buffered read-only streams.
   We cannot use <stdio.h> here, because fopen() calls malloc(), and a malloc()
   call may have been interrupted.
   Also, we cannot use multiple read() calls, because if the buffer size is
   smaller than the file's contents:
     - On NetBSD, the second read() call would return 0, thus making the file
       appear truncated.
     - On DragonFly BSD, the first read() call would fail with errno = EFBIG.
     - On all platforms, if some other thread is doing memory allocations or
       deallocations between two read() calls, there is a high risk that the
       result of these two read() calls don't fit together, and as a
       consequence we will parse garbage and either omit some VMAs or return
       VMAs with nonsensical addresses.
   So use mmap(), and ignore the resulting VMA.
   The stack-allocated buffer cannot be too large, because this can be called
   when we are in the context of an alternate stack of just SIGSTKSZ bytes.  */
